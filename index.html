    <p class="mobile-hide">I've been coding for around 6 years, my coding journey started in junior year of high school when I to a class about web design using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. In my senior year, I worked on an internship at UGA Finance in Kansas City, MO, where I contributed to a variety of projects, including network setups, website redesigns, and IT support. Throughout my time at Northwest Missouri State University, I've had the opportunity to explore various programming languages and learn advance computer science topics. Some of the classes I've taken include Operating Systems, Software Engineering Principles, Database Systems, Machine Learning, and Data Structures. Along this journey, I've discovered a genuine passion for machine learning and backend development.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Computer Vision</h5>
        <p class="card-text">In this project, the goal was to develop an autonomous bot for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) using the  YOLOv8 engine and Python, without relying on internal game data. By using AI and machine learning techniques for real-time visual data interpretation and decision-making, this bot demonstrates an innovative approach to game automation. It skillfully navigates the game environment, identifies opponents, and interacts within the game purely through visual analysis, showcasing the potential of AI in transforming gaming experiences.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Chemistry Learning Enviroment</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Commissioned by a client at Northwest Missouri State University, this project aimed to bridge the educational gap in Chemistry for less fortunate schools. By leveraging the Godot game engine, we developed an engaging and interactive game. This initiative not only made learning more accessible but also transformed the educational experience into an enjoyable journey, illustrating the powerful role of technology in educational equity.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Fraud Detection Model</h5>
        <p class="card-text">In an engaging project from my Machine Learning class, I aimed to simulate authentic bank transaction data, highlighting the challenge of detecting fraud where only 0.05% of transactions were fraudulent. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, I developed a model capable of discerning fraudulent transactions with approximately 78% accuracy. This project not only showcased the intricacies of handling imbalanced datasets but also demonstrated the potential of machine learning in enhancing financial security.</p>
